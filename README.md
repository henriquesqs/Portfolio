# My Portfolio
I've created this project to learn **React.js and TypeScript** funnily and also to allow me to show my CV online.

The deployment to Github-Pages was automated using Github Actions.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies in the node_modules folder

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
